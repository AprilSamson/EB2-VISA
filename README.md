Documentation, such as an official academic record showing that you have a U.S. advanced degree or a foreign equivalent degree, or an official academic record showing that you have a U.S. baccalaureate degree or a foreign equivalent degree and letters from current or former employers showing that you have at least 5 years of progressive post-baccalaureate work experience in the specialty.

## DESCRIPTION

## EVIDENCE
You must meet at least three of the criteria below.*


## Criteria

- Official academic record showing that you have a degree, diploma, certificate, or similar award from a college, university, school, or other institution of learning relating to your area of exceptional ability

- Letters from current or former employers documenting at least 10 years of full-time experience in your occupation

- A license to practice your profession or certification for your profession or occupation

- Evidence that you have commanded a salary or other remuneration for services that demonstrates your exceptional ability

- Membership in a professional association(s)

- Recognition for your achievements and significant contributions to your industry or field by your peers, government entities, professional or business organizations

- Other comparable evidence of eligibility is also acceptable.


## Labor Certification and Ability to Pay. Employment-based, second-preference petitions must usually be accompanied by a certified Application for Permanent Employment Certification from the Department of Labor (DOL) on ETA Form 9089, however, DOL provides for a blanket (Schedule A) certification in certain situations. As part of the application process, your employer must be able to demonstrate an ability to pay the offered wage as of the priority date and continuing until you obtain lawful permanent residence status. Your employer may use an annual report, federal income tax return, or audited financial statement to demonstrate a continuing ability to pay your wage. Finally, you may request a waiver of this requirement in the national interest through the petition filed with USCIS. Because the national interest waiver waives the job offer, you do not need to demonstrate an employer’s ability to pay a wage
